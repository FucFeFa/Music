# System Architecture Overview
The system is designed using a **Client-Server architecture**:

### Front-End (User Interface):
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive web application.

### Back-End (Data Processing and Management):
Built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MySQL** as the database to store user information, songs, playlists, and artists.

# Literature Review
## 2.1 System Architecture Design
The system uses a **Client-Server architecture** where the frontend (client) communicates with the backend (server) to request and receive data. The backend is responsible for **user authentication**, **data retrieval**, and **processing music requests**, while the frontend handles the **user interface** and playback control.

## 2.2 Functionality of Components
- **User Authentication**: Includes registration, login, password recovery, and profile updates.
- **Music Search**: Allows users to search songs by name, artist, or genre.
- **Playlist Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete playlists.
- **Playback Control**: Supports playback controls such as play, pause, skip, and repeat.

# Solution Implementation
## Frontend Implementation
The frontend is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The user interface includes:
- **Homepage**: Displays featured songs and artists.
- **Search Page**: Allows users to search for songs by name, artist, or genre.
- **Music Player**: A simple audio player with controls for play, pause, skip, and volume control.
- **Playlist Management**: Allows users to create and manage playlists.

## Backend Implementation
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MySQL** used to store and retrieve data. Key features include:
- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile management.
- **Song Management**: CRUD operations for songs and playlists.
- **Playback Control**: Handles play, pause, skip, and volume control.

# Testing and Evaluation
## Testing Goals
- Ensure the application functions as expected, with no major bugs or crashes.
- All features such as **music search**, **playlist creation**, and **playback controls** should be fully operational.
- The user interface should be **responsive** across all devices.

## Testing Methods
- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components like backend APIs and frontend JavaScript functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifies interaction between frontend and backend.
- **System Testing**: Ensures the application works as a whole.
- **UI/UX Testing**: Tests the user interface across various devices and browsers.

# Conclusion
The developed **online music streaming platform** successfully integrates essential features such as **music playback**, **playlist management**, and **song searching**, while maintaining smooth performance and scalability. Future work may involve adding advanced features like **music recommendations** and **social sharing**.
